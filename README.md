# About Analysis1

## Introduction

This report, designated as Analysis1, delves into the mental health and academic performance of university students, leveraging data from Kaggle. The impetus for this exploration arises from the growing concern surrounding student mental health, a topic underscored by Iain Brennan and Minister Michelle Donelan.

## Research Topic

Analysis1 aims to uncover correlations between students' academic situations, mental health, and the efficacy of a recent UK government initiative. Key focal points include the year of study, grades (CGPA), mental health status, and treatment history.

## Data Collection / Survey Design

- **Population:** 101 university students participated in the survey conducted via Google Forms.
- **Research Questions:** This analysis investigates academic performance and mental health indicators.
- **Scope:** Emphasis is placed on demographics, course, year of study, CGPA, depression/anxiety/panic attacks, and treatment-seeking.

## Data Overview and Pre-processing

The dataset encompasses information such as gender, age, program, year of study, CGPA, and mental health indicators. Key observations include a predominantly female participant base, most in year 1, and strong academic performance.

## Analysis and Results

- **Demographics:** 74.3% female, primarily aged 18, majoring in engineering, BCS, and BIT.
- **Academic Performance:** CGPA scores are notably high, with the majority ranging from 3.50 to 4.00.
- **Mental Health:** Approximately 63% report mental health issues, with year 1 students being the majority.
- **Treatment-Seeking:** Only 5.9% sought specialist treatment.

## Python Script

This analysis is accompanied by a comprehensive Python script designed for the examination of student mental health issues.

## Conclusions

While the majority of participants exhibit strong academic performance, mental health concerns persist, especially among year 1 students. These findings align with government initiatives aimed at bolstering mental health support for students.
