## Mental Health Analysis Report

### Introduction

This report delves into the mental health and academic performance of university students using a Kaggle dataset, driven by concerns raised by Iain Brennan and Minister Michelle Donelan.

### Research Topic

Explore the correlation between students' academic situation, mental health, and the effectiveness of a new UK government initiative. Key factors include year of study, grades (CGPA), mental health status, and treatment history.

### Data Collection / Survey Design

- **Population:** 101 university students surveyed via Google Forms.
- **Research Questions:** Examine academic performance and mental health indicators.
- **Scope:** Demographics, course, year of study, CGPA, depression/anxiety/panic attacks, and treatment-seeking.

### Data Overview and Pre-processing

The dataset covers gender, age, program, year of study, CGPA, and mental health indicators. Key findings include a majority of female participants, most in year 1, and high academic performance.

### Analysis and Results

- **Demographics:** 74.3% female, mainly aged 18, studying engineering, BCS, and BIT.
- **Academic Performance:** Predominantly high CGPA, with a majority scoring 3.50 to 4.00.
- **Mental Health:** 63% report mental health issues, with year 1 students being the majority.
- **Treatment-Seeking:** Only 5.9% sought specialist treatment.

### Conclusions

While academic performance is high, mental health concerns persist, especially among year 1 students. These findings align with government initiatives targeting mental health support for students.
